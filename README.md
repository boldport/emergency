The tiny engineer superhero emergency kit will save you. Recall the countless times you desperately needed a 1 KOhm resistor to fix an amplifier at a party, only to see whoever you were trying to impress slip away with an OCaml programmer? Never again with this little kit. Consider the times when you were too drunk to recall Ohm's Law, yet was called in to fix a spaceship's control system. V=IR is written on the board to rescue you into awesomeness in spite of your inebriated state.
